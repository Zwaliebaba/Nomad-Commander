<!--
  AGENTS.md §7 is the checklist this mirrors. Delete the parts that do not apply; do not delete
  the parts that do because they are inconvenient.

## What this changes

<!-- One paragraph. What the change does, not what you did to make it. -->

## Why

<!-- The problem, or the decision this implements. Link the ADR or Design/ document if there is
     one; add one if this change IS a decision (Design/README.md says which is which). -->

## How it was verified

<!-- Be specific and be honest. "Builds clean, not run" and "builds and runs" are different
     claims. Say which configurations you actually built. -->

- [ ] `msbuild NomadCommander.slnx /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x64` — clean
- [ ] All four test suites run and pass
- [ ] `python Build\CheckProjectFiles.py`
- [ ] `python Build\CheckFormat.py`
- [ ] `python Build\RunClangTidy.py`
- [ ] Release built locally (CI does not build it — AGENTS.md §6)
- [ ] Ran the executable (**required** if this touches rendering, input, audio or presentation)

## Conformance

- [ ] Naming follows AGENTS.md §1 — `_` on parameters, `m_` on class state, `UPPER_CASE`
      constants, `PascalCase` enumerators, no `I`/`C`/`Base` affixes
- [ ] New, removed or moved files are in the `.vcxproj` **and** the `.filters`
- [ ] Debug and Release still agree on everything AGENTS.md §3 says they must
- [ ] No warning silenced, no `ConformanceMode`/`LanguageStandard`/`WarningLevel` changed
- [ ] No new third-party dependency (R14)
- [ ] No new runtime file dependency — the executable still ships alone (R13)
- [ ] Only the lines the task required were changed
- [ ] If this PR touches a Phase 5 screen: which `Design/UI/UI-Spec.md` sections it implements, and
      one screenshot beside the reference PNG

## Anything you had to bend

<!-- Rules you deviated from and why, assumptions you made, things you noticed but left alone.
     An empty section here is a claim; make sure it is true. -->
